Manual verification: Manual verification is required for the first time (including the code in WhatsApp).
After that, if the browser saves cookies, the verification will be saved.

Recomandation:
0.1 ensure you have installed: 'selenium' , 'webdriver-manager'
  0.1.1 I used Webdriver Manager for Python from: "https://pypi.org/project/webdriver-manager/" ; Used with Chrome. 
0.2 Use the non-gui version, and schedule it for every sunday-morning.  

Important Notes:

Security: The script saves the connection profile in a local folder. Make sure your computer is properly secured.

Updates: If the website changes, the script may need to be updated.

Logs: The script generates a log file named attendance_report.log in the same folder, which will help track the process.
